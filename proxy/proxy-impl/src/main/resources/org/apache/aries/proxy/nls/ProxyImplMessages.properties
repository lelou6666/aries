# {0} The name of the super class
# {1} The name of the class
cannot.load.superclass=Unable to load the super type {0} for class {1}.
# {0}
# {1} The class being weaved
unexpected.error.processing.class=Unexpected error processing {0} when weaving {1}.
# {0} The class being weaved
# {1} The super class
type.lacking.no.arg.constructor=The class {0} and its superclass {1} do not have no-args constructors and cannot be woven.
# {0} The method on the invocation listener

# {0} A class we are trying to generate a subclass proxy for

# {0} A class we are trying to generate a subclass proxy for
no.nonprivate.constructor=The no-argument constructor of class {0} is private and therefore it may not be possible to generate a valid proxy.
# {0} A class we are trying to generate a subclass proxy for
no.nonprivate.noargs.constructor=A valid proxy could not be generated for the class {0}, probably because it does not have an accessible no-args constructor.
# {0} The class that cannot be woven
cannot.weave=The class {0} cannot be woven, it may not be possible for the runtime to proxy this class.
# {0} The class that could not be woven.
